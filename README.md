This project was written for fictional company ABC Security Company and below is the details of it.

ABC Security Company is a new established company that provides security services to various business organizations. The company has many part-time security guards and deploy these guards to its customers based on the service order received. The deployment of security guards need to be very flexible as it has to fulfil the customers’ requirement at very short notices. In this situation, maintaining the attendance history and generating payslip for its security guard employees has been a very difficult task for the administration and human resource department. 

To improve the scenario, the company has decided to implement a computerized system from the next fiscal year that maintains the list of employees, their attendance (deployment in customers’ premise) and generate the payslip based on UK rules (Calculate basic, tax free allowance, tax deduction, NI deduction etc.). 

As I have been hired as the developer I have to design and develop a information system for the company. The major business needs required to address with the new system are as follows:

1.	Maintaining the list of employees (security guards)
2.	Maintaining the attendance (deployment of security guards in customers’ premises)
3.	Generating monthly summary and detailed report of attendance list (number of hours worked, days etc.)
4.	Generating the Pay slip of the employees.
